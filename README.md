cldstk-deploy
=============

cldstk-deploy is a utility for making Apache CloudStack and KVM  installations quick, easy and painless. Meant to be reusable so you can deploy Apache CloudStack more than once after you’ve downloaded the RPMS and system templates locally with cldstk-deploy.

## Features

- can install NFS server ****New****
- cldstk-deploy now creates jobs for each deploy ****New****
- cldstk-deploy now has help using -h
- can pre download Apache CloudStack RPMS (version 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 & 4.10)
- can pre download KVM system template
- runs web server to be used as ISO, RPM and system template repository
- can install and setup cloudstack-management servers (One or many)
- can install and setup mysql database servers (Primary and Repica)
- can install and setup cloudstack-agent KVM hosts
- can preseed KVM system template
- can mix options
- All-In-One Installation
- Basic Zone Configuration setup after deployment
- configures NTP
- Installs CloudMonkey

## Requirements

- CentOS 6.4 or above (**not compatible with CentOS 7**)
- Mac OS X support ****New**** (tested on 10.10.3 and higher)
- Systems must have internet connectivity (this just make sense)
- Host resolution must be working for the systems that runs this process

# Getting Started

## Setting up the environment

1. Download **cldstk-deploy** from Github. 

    **On CentOS**:
    
    `yum install git -y`

    `git clone https://github.com/thehyperadvisor/cldstk-deploy.git`

    **On Mac OSX**:
    
    Download cldstk-deploy from [here](https://github.com/thehyperadvisor/cldstk-deploy/archive/master.zip)
    
    Double click the download to unpack.
    
2. Setup **cldstk-deploy** using the “setup all” option. This prepares the environment and installs all the required packages for **cldstk-deploy** (python and ansible).

    `cd cldstk-deploy`

    `python cldstkdeploy.py —-setup all`

3. Download the Apache Cloudstack RPMS and Systemtemplates all at once. (OPTIONAL) - if you use “Internet” installation type. 

    `python cldstkdeploy.py —-getall 4.10`

4. (OPTIONAL) Build RPMS from source. ONLY 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 & 4.10 for now. ONLY IF YOU DO NOT DOWNLOAD RPMS.

    `python build-4.10.x-rpms.py`

   Takes roughly 10 minutes to build and installs additional packages.

## Usage Instructions

RPM packages and system templates must be in downloaded first when NOT using the “Internet” installation type.

Browse the **cldstk-deploy** directory then run the command below. 

    python cldstkdeploy.py

This will start asking questions from the command prompt.

## All-In-One deployment
